## Project Description
I chose to program Blackjack as a game, because I thought it would be interesting to work with a deck of cards. Alas, due to time constraints, I will submit a simple version of BlackJack that fulfils the project requirements. 

## Rules
- For Vanilla Blackjack I will only use a point system with "cards" numbered 1 - 11. The actual game uses a proper deck of cards.

There is the dealer (pc) and the player (user). The player needs to beat the the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. The dealer and player start with 2 cards each, one of the dealer's cards are "facedown". If the player thinks their cards are sufficient to beat the dealer they can "STAY", cards are tallied and the game ends, with the closest to 21 being the winner. If a player needs more cards they can "HIT" which gives them 1 card. A player can hit as many times as they like, but all card values will count toward their total. If they exceed 21, it's a "BUST", which means the dealer wins.
              
## Workflow
- Researched online for examples and ideas on coding Blackjack with Python
- Outlined what I will need to code (e.g card deck, game rules, dealer, player, etc.)
- Defined rules of the game
- Set up my workspace (created git repo, created jupyter notebook, created Trello board)
- Split up project into mini-projects according to functions required in the game
- testing, testing, testing
- Reviewed where code could be split into functions
- More testing
- Done.

## Organization
I used Trello to keep track of what I am doing. My repo only contains the one directory.
