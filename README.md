## Project Description
I chose to program Blackjack as a game, because I thought it would be interesting to work with a deck of cards and (bonus) hopefully I can find some interesting ways to code the game logic.

## Rules
In its most basic form – there is the dealer (pc) and the player (user). The player needs to beat the the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. The dealer and player start with 2 cards each (see card values below). If the player thinks their cards are sufficient to beat the dealer they can "stand", cards are tallied and the game ends, with the closest to 21 being the winner. If a player needs more cards they can "hit" which gives them 1 card. A player can hit as many times as they like, but all card values will count toward their total. If they exceed 21, it's a "bust", which means the dealer wins.

** If the player "stands" and has a better hand than the dealer, the dealer will "hit" until they beat the player or "bust".

Card values:  
- Cards 2 - 10 have are the value of the number on their face.
- Jack, Queen, King are valued at 10
- Ace can be 1 or 11 (whatever keeps you in the game)
              
## Workflow
- Outlined what I will need to code (card deck, game rules, dealer, player, initiate game)
- Defined rules of the game
- Set up my workspace (created git repo, created jupyter notebook, created Trello board)
- Split up project into mini-projects according to functions required in the game
- testing, testing, testing
- Done.

## Organization
I used Trello to keep track of what I am doing. My repo only contains the one jupyter notebook.
